OmniJaws(by OmniRom) + Providers

Fork OmniJaws (now the main repository has become private) from OmniRom, adapted for the build in Android studio, and added providers of weather data, at the moment it is:
1. Gismeteo
2. AccuWeather
3. MET Norway - yr.no (was later added to main repository)
4. Pirate Weather (test replacement for discontinued Dark Sky)
5. The Weather Channel - weather.com
6. Yandex Weather
7. Weatherbit
8. Foreca

<details>
  <summary>Apk for Android 13</summary>
  Contains almost all (except PirateWeather and Weatherbit) providers from the list above, added through recompilation apk from the ROM, so the source code for self-build is not available.
